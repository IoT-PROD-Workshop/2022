# International Workshop on Internet of Things Pervasive Real-World Deployments (IoT-PROD)

During the last decade the Information Technology ecosystem has been significantly revolutionized by the advent of the Internet of Things (IoT) and its quick and pervasive evolution. We will have billions of heterogeneous interconnected devices denoted as “Smart Objects” able to generate and consume a huge amount of data and enabling new forms of cyber-physical interaction between people and things in an increasing number of challenging application scenarios. For a long time, the Internet of Things has been mainly driven by academics and only during the last years companies and industrial players understood the real potential of these technologies and started guiding the fourth industrial revolution. This new trend uncovered a plethora of new, open and appealing technological challenges (affecting all architectural layers) associated to the design and deployment of innovative IoT technologies out of the comfort zone bringing them to the real world and to production-ready environments.

IoT-PROD’22 aims to provide a forum that brings together authors from the research and industrial communities, standardization bodies, and institutional entities to meet and exchange ideas on recent research, challenges and future directions for IoT real-world deployments in multiple application scenarios. The technical discussion will be focused on the presentation of interoperable, pervasive, secure and scalable solutions able to take advantages of the key enabling technologies for IoT, especially Edge/Fog Computing, Hybrid Cloud architectures, Artificial Intelligence, Human–machine interaction together with Pervasive and Mobile computing approaches. The technical topics of interest to the workshop include, but are not limited to:

* IoT Real-World Deployments
* IoT Connectivity Standards
* IoT Semantic Interoperability Standards
* IoT Sustainability and Energy Awareness
* IoT Applications solutions and innovations
* IoT Privacy
* Edge Computing deployments and architectures
* Edge and Cloud interoperability and integration
* Digital Twin oriented approaches and cyber physical interaction applications
* Emerging AI techniques and adoption on large scale datasets
* Application and case studies of 5G and IoT
* Pervasive environment and Tactile Internet
* Tooling for diagnostics, monitoring and decreasing operational costs while increasing system availability
* IoT root cause and predictive analysis in large networks
* Multi-region/multi-vendor autonomic adaptation
* IoT systems of systems (large scale, multi-region, multi-use case)
* Mobility challenges and Edge Computing
* Software Engineering and Architecture for IoT (reusability of AI models, pay per feature, microservices)
* Longevity of IoT deployments

## Important Dates
* **Paper submission deadline: November 14, 2021**
* **Paper notification: January 5, 2022**

## Submission Details (Subject to Change)
Paper submission must be done for the main conference and all associated events via EDAS. If you do not have an EDAS account, please, register first (it’s free) via the following link: [TBD](). The direct submission link for IoT-PROD 2022 is [TBD]().

IoT-PROD 2022 will follow a double-blind review process. As a result, authors must make a good faith effort to anonymize their submissions.

Submitted papers must be unpublished and not considered elsewhere for publication. Also, they must show a significant relevance to pervasive computing and communications. Submitted papers will undergo a rigorous review process handled by the Technical Program Committee. Only electronic submissions in PDF format will be considered.

The IEEE LaTeX and Microsoft Word templates, as well as formatting instructions, can be found [here](https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html). Papers must be at most 6 pages of technical content (10pt font, 2-column format), including text, figures, and tables and up to one additional page for references only.

Accepted papers will be published in IEEE Xplore. All accepted papers will be invited to submit an associated artifact abstract providing the code, data, results, etc. associated with the contribution.
